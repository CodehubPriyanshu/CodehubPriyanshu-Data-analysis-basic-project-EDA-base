# 📊 EDA Projects - Data Analysis Using Python
This repository contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects using Python. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning techniques applied to various datasets.

### 📌 This project was created as part of my data science learning journey.

# 📂 Project Overview
This repository consists of multiple EDA experiments on different datasets. Each project focuses on cleaning, transforming, visualizing, and deriving insights from data.

✅ Data Preprocessing - Handling missing values, formatting data, and standardizing datasets.
✅ Data Visualization - Using matplotlib and seaborn for insightful charts and graphs.
✅ Feature Engineering - Extracting meaningful features from datasets.
✅ Machine Learning Applications - Regression, clustering, and classification techniques.
✅ Time Series Forecasting - Predicting future trends using statistical models.

# 📌 Projects Included
### 1️⃣ EDA on Student Dataset
Analyzes student activities, screen time, and mood ratings.
Investigates relationships between study habits and academic performance.
Uses boxplots, heatmaps, and histograms to explore trends.
  📄 Dataset: Student.csv
